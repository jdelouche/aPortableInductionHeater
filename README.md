# A Portable Induction Heater

## Description

This is a hardware design that can be used to create a portable induction heater.

The design uses a Texas Instrument C2000 Launchpad with a TMS320F28027 microcontroller and a full bridge MOSFET power stage. The MOSFETs are driven by the UCC27111 which are connected to the microcontroller enhanced PWM.

The power stage is managed through software with a high-frequency PWM ramp-up.
